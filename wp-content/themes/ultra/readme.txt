== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I make drop down menu items open to the left instead of the right? =

By default drop down menus appear to the right of their parent menu item. Right alignment can be problematic for menu items close to the end of the screen, causing items to disappear off the edge of the screen. Ultra doesn't automatically adjust for this but does offer a manual solution. To change the direction of a drop down menu, follow these steps:

1. Go to Appearance > Menus and click Screen Options top right. Under "Show advanced menu properties" enable "CSS classes".

2. Locate a drop down parent menu item and click the down arrow next to the menu item name.

3. Go to the CSS Classes (optional) field and enter the following word: left

= How do I add social icons to the top and bottom bar? =

1. Ultra makes use of a social icon menu system managed from Appearance > Menus. Icons are rendered by the [Font Awesome library](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). Navigate to Appearance > Menus and click the "create a new menu" link. Choose a name for your menu and click the blue "Save Menu" button. Next look at the left column and locate the "Custom Links" tab, open it and add your first network. For example if we were adding a Twitter icon for Puro Themes we'd add the following to the URL field: https://twitter.com/purothemes

2.The URL should be a link to your profile page on one of the support networks above. The Link Text can be anything you'd like, it won't be displayed on the front end of your site.

3. Once you've added your networks, scroll down to the bottom of the page and locate the Theme Locations sub-heading under the Menu Settings heading. Locate the social icon menu locations (Top Bar Social Menu and Bottom Bar Social Menu) and select the ones you want. Lastly, click the "Save Menu" button again.
